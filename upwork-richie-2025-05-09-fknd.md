## SB1: Core Architecture Overview

- **SD-PMP-1 [P:95%] [TAG:FOUNDATION]:** The Multi-Level Processor (MLP) v14.1.0 architecture implements a sophisticated processing system with configurable levels, each associated with specific dimensional parameters, processing phases, and timeout constraints.

- **SD-PMP-2 [P:95%] [TAG:PATTERNS]:** Information flows through the system in a structured pattern, starting with level selection based on dimensional analysis, flowing through configured phases, and concluding with comprehensive artifact collection and error handling.
  - **SBR-1 [P:90%]:** [SD-PMP-1 → SD-PMP-2] The level-based architecture establishes the foundation for the information flow, ensuring appropriate processing contexts for each workflow.

### SF1.1: Multi-Level Processor Foundation

- **SD-1 [P:99%] [TAG:CORE]:** The core `MultiLevelProcessor` class manages a collection of processing levels, each defined with a unique identifier, dimensional value, phase sequence, and timeout parameter.
  - **SBR-2 [P:95%]:** [SD-1 → SD-2] The level configuration directly influences how a given context will be processed throughout the system.

- **SD-2 [P:99%] [TAG:LEVELS]:** Levels are stored in a Map structure for efficient retrieval, with an ordered array maintaining sequence for level selection when dimension-based matching is ambiguous.
  - **SBR-3 [P:95%]:** [SD-2 → SD-3] This dual storage approach balances retrieval efficiency with ordered fallback selection.

- **SD-3 [P:99%] [TAG:SELECTION]:** Level selection uses dimensional proximity, finding the level whose dimension value most closely matches the context's dimension, within a configurable maximum distance.
  - **SBR-4 [P:95%]:** [SD-3 → SD-4] This proximity-based selection creates contextually appropriate processing pathways.

- **SD-4 [P:99%] [TAG:MANAGEMENT]:** The system provides methods for adding, removing, and editing levels, with validation ensuring consistency and preventing removal of the last available level.
  - **SBR-5 [P:95%]:** [SD-4 → SD-1] These management methods enable dynamic reconfiguration while maintaining system integrity.

### SF1.2: Processing Workflow Model

- **SD-5 [P:99%] [TAG:PROCESS]:** The primary processing entry point is the `process` method, which accepts a context object and optional cancellation token, returning the processed context with accumulated artifacts.
  - **SBR-6 [P:95%]:** [SD-5 → SD-6] This method orchestrates the entire processing lifecycle from initialization to completion or error handling.

- **SD-6 [P:99%] [TAG:PHASES]:** Processing occurs through a sequence of phases, with each phase implemented as a registered processor that transforms the context and creates artifacts.
  - **SBR-7 [P:95%]:** [SD-6 → SD-7] This phase-based approach enables specialized processing at different stages of the workflow.

- **SD-7 [P:99%] [TAG:EXECUTION]:** Phase execution occurs through the PUF (Pattern Selection, Pattern Collection, State Transition) cycle, which selects patterns based on the active level, applies them to create artifacts, and updates dimensional state.
  - **SBR-8 [P:95%]:** [SD-7 → SD-8] The PUF cycle creates a consistent execution model across different levels and phases.

- **SD-8 [P:99%] [TAG:ARTIFACTS]:** Each processing phase generates artifacts containing phase-specific outputs, which are collected in the context's `dimensionalArtifacts` property, organized by layer.
  - **SBR-9 [P:95%]:** [SD-8 → SD-9] These artifacts form the concrete outputs of the processing workflow, available for analysis and utilization.

### SF1.3: Error Handling and Validation

- **SD-9 [P:99%] [TAG:ERRORS]:** The system implements a specialized `ProcessingError` class with type categorization (TIMEOUT, VALIDATION, EXECUTION, LEVEL_NOT_FOUND, CANCELLED), message, and contextual data.
  - **SBR-10 [P:95%]:** [SD-9 → SD-10] This error structure enables precise identification and handling of different failure modes.

- **SD-10 [P:99%] [TAG:VALIDATION]:** Validation occurs at multiple points: level configuration, context structure, input parameters, and phase execution, preventing invalid operations before they cause cascading failures.
  - **SBR-11 [P:95%]:** [SD-10 → SD-11] This multi-layered validation creates a robust defense against invalid inputs and configurations.

- **SD-11 [P:99%] [TAG:TIMEOUT]:** Timeout handling uses Promise racing between processing execution and timeout rejection, ensuring operations don't exceed their allocated time limits.
  - **SBR-12 [P:95%]:** [SD-11 → SD-12] This timeout mechanism prevents runaway processes from consuming excessive resources.

- **SD-12 [P:99%] [TAG:CANCELLATION]:** Cancellation support uses a token-based approach with `CancellationToken` interface and `CancellationTokenSource` implementation, enabling controlled termination of in-progress operations.
  - **SBR-13 [P:95%]:** [SD-12 → SD-9] This cancellation system integrates with error handling to provide clean termination pathways.

### SF1.4: Observability and Event System

- **SD-13 [P:99%] [TAG:EVENTS]:** The system implements an event system with typed events (processingStarted, phaseStarted, phaseCompleted, processingCompleted, processingFailed) and listeners for operational observability.
  - **SBR-14 [P:95%]:** [SD-13 → SD-14] This event system enables monitoring and reaction to processing lifecycle events.

#### SFD1: Implementation Pathways [Time × Collaboration]
Time dimension spans from immediate (days) through short-term (weeks) to medium-term (months).
Collaboration dimension spans from FrostTec-led through Shared to Client-led responsibilities.

##### SDM1: Immediate-Shared Implementation [Immediate × Shared]
This domain covers the collaborative work needed in the immediate term.
- **SD-81 [P:95%]:** The highest priority immediate shared task is resolving TypeScript compilation errors through collaborative debugging sessions, with both FrostTec and client developers contributing expertise to fix type compatibility issues.
  - **SBR-86 [P:90%]:** [SD-81 → SDM2:SD-82] Resolving these errors creates the foundation for all subsequent implementation work.

##### SDM2: Short-Term-Shared Implementation [Short-Term × Shared]
This domain covers the collaborative work needed in the coming weeks.
- **SD-82 [P:95%]:** The key short-term shared task is validating actual GPT-4o API integration, with FrostTec providing implementation expertise and the client providing API access and validation scenarios.
  - **SBR-87 [P:90%]:** [SDM1:SD-81 → SD-82] This validation builds upon the fixed codebase to confirm real-world functionality.

## SKN1: Processing-Response-Quality Feedback Loop

- **SD-83 [P:95%]:** [SD-PMP-2 ↔ SD-PMP-4 ↔ SD-PMP-6 ↔ SD-PMP-8 ↔ SD-PMP-10 ↺] Processing workflow creates a foundation for API interaction (Snowbank 1), which enables optimized API responses (Snowbank 2), validated by comprehensive testing (Snowbank 3), maintained through quality practices (Snowbank 4), and improved through collaborative implementation (Snowbank 5), with testing results feeding back into workflow refinements, creating a continuous improvement cycle.

- **SD-84 [P:95%] [TAG:CONCLUSION]:** The MLP_GPT4o implementation represents a sophisticated integration of the GPT-4o API with a flexible processing framework, creating a robust foundation for dimensional processing of language model interactions while maintaining adaptability for varied usage scenarios.

- **SD-85 [P:95%] [TAG:REMINDER]:** This implementation requires collaborative effort to resolve remaining issues before production readiness, with a recommended meeting between FrostTec and client developers to establish shared understanding and next steps for successful implementation.
